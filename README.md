# basic-Capture-and-Analyze-Network-Traffic-Using-Wireshark.
  Objective
The primary objective was to capture live network packets using the Wireshark tool and identify basic protocols and types of traffic generated by standard network activity.

  Tools Used:-
  
Wireshark (Free network protocol analyzer) 

   Summary of Work Completed:-
   
I completed the following steps to fulfill the task requirements:

Installed Wireshark and identified my active network interface.

Initiated a live packet capture on the active interface.

Generated network traffic by browsing a public website and/or pinging a server.

Stopped the capture after observing traffic.

Filtered the captured data to analyze specific protocols (e.g., 

HTTP, DNS, TCP).

Successfully identified and documented at least 3 distinct protocols present in the capture.
for privacy reason i can not provide (.pcap) file.
